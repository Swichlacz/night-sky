## Mrs. Purkapile

_By Edgar Lee Masters_ 


He ran away and was gone for a year.<br>
When he came home he told me the silly story<br>
Of being kidnapped by pirates on Lake Michigan<br>
And kept in chains so he could not write me.<br>
I pretended to believe it, though I knew very well<br>
What he was doing, and that he met<br>
The milliner, Mrs. Williams, now and then<br>
When she went to the city to buy goods, as she said.<br>
But a promise is a promise<br>
And marriage is marriage, <br>
And out of respect for my own character <br>
I refused to be drawn into a divorce<br>
By the scheme of a husband who had merely grown tired<br>
Of his marital vow and duty.<br>
