## Mrs. Purkapile

_By Edgar Lee Masters_ 




        He ran away and was gone for a year.
        When he came home he told me the silly story
        
        Of being kidnapped by pirates on Lake Michigan
        And kept in chains so he could not write me.
        
        I pretended to believe it, though I knew very well
        What he was doing, and that he met
        
        The milliner, Mrs. Williams, now and then
        When she went to the city to buy goods, as she said.
        
        But a promise is a promise
        And marriage is marriage, 
        
        And out of respect for my own character 
        I refused to be drawn into a divorce
        
        By the scheme of a husband who had merely grown tired
        Of his marital vow and duty.
